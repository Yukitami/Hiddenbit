Hi !! Iâ€™m Kenrighan. I study, build, and think a lot about what *meaning* means and how it comes to be .
I tried to make projects that are weird, they don't have to be good just unique.
You can find my [projects list here](/projects).

I also occasionaly write [blog posts](/posts) about whatever catches my attention.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography, I post [photos on this page](/photos), 
I love anime, movies and music, Here's my list of [favorite media](/media).
